<div>
The location to read or write the fitnesse results xml file  
e.g. /home/hudson/projects/project/fitnesse-results.xml or c:\projects\project\fitnesse-results.xml
If file is specified without a path it will be written to the Hudson workspace.
When running FitNesse is externally and only the results shall be visualized you can specify 
an Ant FileSet pattern here. That way, you can visualize multiple test results by specifying the path like this:
testresults/**/fitnesse-results*.xml
